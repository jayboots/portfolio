# Assignment 1: Student Portfolio

## Objectives

You will build a personal portfolio website using HTML/CSS in your `portfolio` GitHub code repository.

The `portfolio` should incorporate your resume as outlined in the labs. The portfolio should also include a `projects` section which will include a technical (and visual) outline of a previous project (from a lab, previous course or some other experience you might have).

In subsequent assignments you can incorporate additional technologies / frameworks and interactivity, but for this first
delivery, limit to plain HTML and CSS.

## Deliverables

You will submit all code in your `portfolio` GitHub code repository.
The portfolio website should be placed in   `public` directory
(with the base page `/public/index.html`).

You will be graded on the following criteria.
| Mark | Breakdown | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 25 |     | Portfolio Implementation|
|      | 10 | Quality of HTML|
|      | 10 | Quality of CSS|
|      | 5 | Intergation of resume into portfolio|
| 3|     | Overall quality of project deliverable|
| 2|     | Git usage (small meaningful commits progressing towards end-goal)|

Total Marks = 30
